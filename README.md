Various Work with R

This is all work published in an HTML format. This was all achieved using R Markdown and all RMD files were coded in R. 

Download the HTML files to see the proper codes. Within each HTML file, it is possible to download the RMD file that created the HTML file.

NOTE: There are certaine KML files that require Google Earth. Some of the RMD files create KML files with animation. Download Google Earth to see such files.
